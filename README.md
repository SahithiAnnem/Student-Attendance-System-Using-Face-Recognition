# Student-Attendance-System-Using-Face-Recognition
The automated attendance management system has a very simple and easy to implement the architecture. The system consists of two datasets, a student dataset, and an attendance dataset.
The student dataset is for storing the details of the student in a particular class. On the other hand, the attendance dataset, as the name suggests, is for marking and maintaining the attendance records of students attending a particular lecture. To achieve the project objective, firstly, video segments are captured of the classroom lecture. Pre-processing of video is done to remove unwanted artifacts i.e., noise and other invariants. The next stage demonstrates detection of faces from the complex backgrounds and recognition of human being.
